### Lab XX - BST ADT implemented with static array

You are given the declaration of template class BSTA which will implement a binary search tree ADT using a static array. Some of the member functions are implemented for you:

* the `operator<<` is overloaded so that you can print the contents of the tree using the instruction `cout << theNameOfYourBSTAOibject`;

You will implement the following:

* the constructor
* `bool search(const T &e)`
* `bool insert(const T &e)`
* `bool remove(const T &e)`

A client is provided that allows the user to invoke the various member functions of a BSTA object.
